View Maps
******************

There are two ways to view maps.

Each map entry creates an icon with map link on the dashboard.

Alternatively, if you are not using the backend component, maps can be accessed directly using syntax blow:

 https://geoexhibit.com/<appFolder>/map.php?id=<id>
 
 Where appFolder is the directory you installed the application and id is the map id from the database row.
