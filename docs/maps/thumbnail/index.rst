******************
Set Thumbnail
******************

By default, the thumbnail for all maps is /assets/maps/default.png

To set a thumbnail for maps, upload <id>.png to the /assets/maps folder, where <id> is the map id.

As shown below, only maps 1 and 3 will have a custom thumbnail, all other maps will use default.png

      .. image:: _static/thumbnail.png

      
The default.png is below, but it can be changed to any png you wish to use.


      .. image:: _static/default.png
